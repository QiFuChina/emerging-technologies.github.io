## Assessment information
The module will be fully assessed through continuous assessment - there is no final exam.
This is broken down as follows.

| Type                                  | Weight |
| --------------------------------------|--------|
| Programming project                   |   40%  |
| Infrastructures and analytics project |   40%  |
| New technologies presentation         |   20%  |

The programming project will consist of four problem sets submitted throughout the module.
These will inform the infrastructures and analytics project, which will be a single cohesive submission.
Finally, students will present their project at the end of the semester.


## Language

For this module we will be using the [Python programming language](https://www.python.org/).


## Module description

This module will introduce the student to new and emerging technologies in computing.
Technologies such as new programming languages, new types of data structures, new types of software infrastructure, and new communications protocols will be investigated.


## Learning outcomes

On completion of this module the learner will be able to:
    
1. Quickly adapt to new programming languages and styles.
2. Discuss and explain proposed new web technology standards.
3. Identify new types of applications that can be developed using newly available data infrastructures.
4. Utilise new systems and frameworks to analyse data.


## Syllabus

### Programming languages
