# Problem set: Tensorflow
These problems relate to [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [numpy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-dev/user/quickstart.html).
We will again use the famous [iris data set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set).
Save your work as a single Jupyter notebook file in a GitHub repository.
Include any required data files, a README, and a gitignore file in the repository.


## 1. Use Tensorflow to create model
Use Tensorflow to create a model to predict the Species of Iris from a flower's sepal width, sepal length, petal width, and petal length.

## 2. Split the data into training and testing
Split the data set into a training set and a testing set.
If you wish to, you can write some code to randomly do this on the fly.

## 3. Train the model
Use the testing set to train your model.

## 4. Test the model
Use the testing set to test your model.
